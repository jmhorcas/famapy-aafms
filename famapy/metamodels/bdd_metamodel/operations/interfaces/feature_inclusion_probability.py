class FeatureInclusionProbability(Operation):
    """The Feature Inclusion Probability (FIP) operation determines the probability 
    for a feature to be included in a valid product. 
    
    It obtains, for each feature, the proportion of valid products that include it.
    
    This operation in combination with the Product Distribution (PD) operation
    provides a clear picture of the products' homogeneity (i.e., how much does one product differ from the others).
    The product's homogeneity is one the three core metrics that characterize the complexity of a SPL.
    The other two core metrics are the number of features the SPL manages, 
    and the number of valid product that can be derived.
