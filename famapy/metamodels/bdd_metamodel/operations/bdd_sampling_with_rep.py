    """Uniform Random Sampling (URS) using a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD).
    
    This is a counting-based sampling inspired in the Knuth algorithm presented in Section 7.1.4 of
    [Donald E. Knuth. 2009. The Art of Computer Programming, 
    Volume 4, Fascicle 1: Bitwise Tricks & Techniques; Binary Decision Diagrams. 
    Addison-Wesley Professional.]

    Knuth showed how to accomplish uniform random sampling by subsequently partitioning the SAT solution space on variable assignments, 
    and then counting the number of solutions of the resulting parts. 

    The original algorithm by Knuth is specified on BDDs very efficiently, 
    as the probabilities required for all the possible SAT solutions are computed just once with a single BDD traversal, 
    and then reused every time a solution is generated. 
    Knuthâ€™s algorithm can be also adapted to SAT technology.

    This implementation only traverses the BDD once, 
    but it only support sample with replacement.
